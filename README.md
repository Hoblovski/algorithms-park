# Algorithm libraries
This repository contains my implementation for various algorithms.

My implementation is targeted at ACM or Olympiad in Informatics,
so don't tell me about bad code style or they are not generic.

Current implementations:
* **rsort**: sort `int` blazing fast
* **fastio**: IO with `unsigned`, blazing fast
* **fastrand**: xorshift RNG, very fast
* **treap**: balanced binary search tree, with *insert*, *delete*, *rank* and *select*
* **nt**: various number theory algorithms
